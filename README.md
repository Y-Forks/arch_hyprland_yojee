- Hyprland-Dots use are constantly evolving / improving. you can check CHANGELOGS here [`Hyprland-Dots-Changelogs`](https://github.com/JaKooLit/Hyprland-Dots/wiki/Changelogs) 
- Since the Hyprland-Dots are evolving, some of the screenshots maybe old
- the wallpaper offered to be downloaded towards the end is from this [`REPO`](https://github.com/JaKooLit/Wallpaper-Bank)

#### Prerequisites
- Minimal Arch Linux installed.

#### Pipewire and Pipewire audio
- This script will install pipewire and will also disable or will uninstall pulseaudio. If you dont want it, you can simply just delete pipewire.sh in install-scripts folder before installing. 

#### Costumize the packages to be installed
- inside the install-scripts folder, you can edit 00-hypr-pkgs.sh. Care though as the Hyprland Dots may not work properly!
- default GTK theme if agreed to be installed is Tokyo night GTK themes (dark and light) + Tokyo night SE icons

#### NVidia GPU Owners.
- By default, nvidia-dkms will be installed. and only supports GTX 900 and newer. If required to install older driver, edit the nvidia.sh in scripts-folder
> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you want to use nouveau driver, choose N when asked if you have nvidia gpu. This is because the nvidia installer part, it will blacklist nouveau. Hyprland will still be installed but it will skip blacklisting nouveau.

#### to run
> clone this repo (latest commit only) to reduce file size download by using git. Change directory, make executable and run the script

```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/JaKooLit/Arch-Hyprland.git
cd Arch-Hyprland
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```
#### for ZSH and OH-MY-ZSH installation
> installer should auto change your default shell to zsh. However, if it does not, do this
```bash
chsh -s $(which zsh)
zsh
source ~/.zshrc
```
- reboot or logout
- by default agnoster theme is installed. You can find more themes from this [`OH-MY-ZSH-THEMES`](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/wiki/Themes)
- to change the theme, edit ~/.zshrc . Look for ZSH_THEME="desired theme"

## some known issues
- reports from members of my discord, states that some users of nvidia are getting stuck on sddm login. credit  to @Kenni Fix stated was 

```  
 while in sddm press ctrl+alt+F2 or F3
log into your account
`lspci -nn`, find the id of your nvidia card
`ls /dev/dri/by-path` find the matching id
`ls -l /dev/dri/by-path` to check where the symlink points to 
)
```
- add "env = WLR_DRM_DEVICES,/dev/dri/cardX" to the ENVvariables config (.config/hypr/UserConfigs/ENVariables.conf)  ; X being where the symlink of the gpu points to
